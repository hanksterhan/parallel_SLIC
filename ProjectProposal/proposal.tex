\author{Author2, Author3 \\ 
Computer Science Department, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA  19081}

\maketitle

\section {Introduction}\label{intro} 
A 1-2 paragraph summary of the problem you are solving, why it is interesting,
how you are solving it, and what conclusions 
you expect to draw from your work.

\section {Related Work}\label{rel}
1-2 paragraphs describing similar approaches to the one you propose. This need
not be an exhaustive summary of related literature, but should be used to put
your solution in context and/or to support your solution. This is also a good
way to motivate your work. This can be a summary taken from your longer
annotated bibliography.  

Here is an example of how to cite someting from the bib 
file~\cite{newhall:nswap2L}.  Here is another~\cite{unixV}.  
The proposal.bib file has some example 
bibtex entries you can use as a guide for entering your own.

In the Annotated Bibliography~\ref{annon} you will included an expanded description of your related work (and you should cite there as well.

\section {Your Solution}\label{soln}
3-4 paragraphs describing what you plan to do, how you plan to do it, how it
solves the problem, and what types of conclusions you expect to draw from your
work.

\section {Experiments}\label{exper}
1-3 paragraphs describing how you plan to evaluate your work. List the
experiments you will perform. For each experiment, explain how you will perform
it and what the results will show (explain why you are performing a particular
test).

\section {Equipment Needed}\label{equip}
1 paragraph listing any software tools that you will need to implement and/or
test your work. If you need to have software installed to implement your
project, you should check with the systems lab to see if it is something that
can be installed on the CS lab machines.

\section {Schedule}\label{sched}
list the specific steps that you will take to complete your project, include
dates and milestones. This is particularly important to help keep you on track,
and to ensure that if you run into difficulties completing your entire project,
you have at least implemented steps along the way. Also, this is a great way to
get specific feedback from me about what you plan to do and how you plan to do
it.  Conclusions: 1 paragraph summary of what you are doing, why, how, and what
you hope to demonstrate through your work.
