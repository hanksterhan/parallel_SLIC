Use nvidia-smi to watch the GPU

## workflows
 - boundary recall metric
 - timing
 - debug: why don't big(ish) images work?
 - debug: why doesn't our code produce slic-like segments
 - debug: todos
 - slico
 - enforce_connectivity on cuda_labels
 - abstract
 - other implementations of kernals (ex. per pixel recompute_centroids)
 - use pre-processing kernal
 - refactor code to make it easier to time different implementations
 - display superpixels as average values
