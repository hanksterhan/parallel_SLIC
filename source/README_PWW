Week 5 (by May 4): 6D extension
Week 6 (by May 11): Write paper
May 13: Presentation


This week, Tai and Rachel worked on parallelizing the SLIC algorithm, while Henry worked on
parallelizing the pre- and post-processing of the data. There were some hiccups with PyCuda at
the start of the week, but Tai and Rachel were able to theorize and think through the CUDA 
implementation of the algorithm, and will begin coding it as soon as possible. Henry is working
on creating parallel versions of a few particular function calls which are key bottlenecks in
the data processing. Neither of these parallelisms are runnable right now, but we aim to have
the SLIC algorithm working on the GPU in time for our presentation.
